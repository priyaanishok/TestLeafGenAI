"| ID | Title | Category | Description | Expected Result |\n|----|-------|----------|-------------|-----------------|\n| NTF‑001 | **Performance – Transfer Throughput** | Performance | Verify that 100 simultaneous transfer requests are processed without failure. | All 100 transfers succeed within the defined SLA (≤ 2 s each). |\n| NTF‑002 | **Performance – Response Time (Single)** | Performance | Measure the response time for a single transfer request. | Response ≤ 1 s. |\n| NTF‑003 | **Performance – Load Spike** | Performance | Simulate a sudden spike from 10 to 200 concurrent users. | System remains stable, no error codes > 500. |\n| NTF‑004 | **Reliability – Crash Recovery** | Reliability | Force a crash during a transfer transaction. | On restart, the transaction is either fully committed or rolled back; balances remain consistent. |\n| NTF‑005 | **Reliability – Data Persistence** | Reliability | Perform a transfer, then simulate a power failure immediately after. | After reboot, the source balance is decremented and the destination incremented accordingly. |\n| NTF‑006 | **Availability – 24/7 Service** | Availability | Verify the system can process transfers 24 h a day, 7 days a week. | No scheduled downtime; SLA ≥ 99.9 %. |\n| NTF‑007 | **Scalability – Account Volume** | Scalability | Test transfer when the customer has 500 linked accounts. | UI remains responsive; transfer completes within SLA. |\n| NTF‑008 | **Security – Encryption In‑Transit** | Security | Capture network traffic during a transfer. | All sensitive data (amount, account IDs, PIN) is encrypted (TLS 1.2+). |\n| NTF‑009 | **Security – Encryption At Rest** | Security | Verify the database fields for account balances and transaction logs are encrypted. | Fields are encrypted with AES‑256. |\n| NTF‑010 | **Security – Input Validation (SQLi)** | Security | Attempt SQL injection in the source/destination account fields. | Input is sanitized; no injection executed. |\n| NTF‑011 | **Security – Input Validation (XSS)** | Security | Input malicious JavaScript in the transfer amount field. | No script execution; input is escaped. |\n| NTF‑012 | **Security – Authentication** | Security | Try to initiate a transfer without logging in. | Access denied; user is redirected to login. |\n| NTF‑013 | **Security – Authorization** | Security | Logged‑in user A attempts to transfer from user B’s account. | Access denied; audit log records attempt. |\n| NTF‑014 | **Usability – Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)** | Usability | Use a screen reader to navigate the transfer form. | All elements are accessible with ARIA labels; transfer can be completed. |\n| NTF‑015 | **Usability – Mobile Responsiveness** | Usability | Access the transfer page on a 5‑inch phone. | Layout adapts; fields are touch‑friendly; transfer completes. |\n| NTF‑016 | **Usability – Error Messaging** | Usability | Enter an amount exceeding available balance. | Clear error message: “Insufficient funds.” |\n| NTF‑017 | **Compliance – Logging Accuracy** | Compliance | Verify that each transfer logs a unique transaction ID and timestamp. | Log entry contains UUID, UTC timestamp, source/dest accounts, amount. |\n| NTF‑018 | **Compliance – Data Retention** | Compliance | Check that transaction logs are retained for 7 years. | System archives logs in accordance with policy. |\n| NTF‑019 | **Audit – Traceability** | Audit | Perform a transfer and then audit the database. | Source balance decreased, destination increased; audit trail records the change. |\n| NTF‑020 | **Audit – Immutable Ledger** | Audit | Attempt to modify a past transaction record. | System prevents edits; attempts are logged. |\n\n---\n\n### Total Non‑Functional Test Cases\n\n**20 test cases** (IDs NTF‑001 – NTF‑020)\n\n---\n\n## CSV for Excel\n\n```csv\nID,Title,Category,Description,Expected Result\nNTF-001,Performance – Transfer Throughput,Performance,Verify that 100 simultaneous transfer requests are processed without failure,All 100 transfers succeed within the defined SLA (≤ 2 s each)\nNTF-002,Performance – Response Time (Single),Performance,Measure the response time for a single transfer request,Response ≤ 1 s\nNTF-003,Performance – Load Spike,Performance,Simulate a sudden spike from 10 to 200 concurrent users,System remains stable, no error codes > 500\nNTF-004,Reliability – Crash Recovery,Reliability,Force a crash during a transfer transaction,On restart, the transaction is either fully committed or rolled back;
